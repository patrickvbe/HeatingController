# Libraries

These are shared libraries in the project. Because of the limitations of the Arduino IDE, they have to be duplicated in each sketch folder. On my system, the src folders of both the PumpController and the MainController are links to the Libraries folder. So although git sees them as separate folders, the are not (should not be).
If you checkout this repository with the idea of working in it, I advice you to do the same.
